# Lost in Space: A 2D Vertical Scroller Game
The game is a 2D vertical scroller which utilizes physics concepts such as
momentum, gravity, and velocity to both aid and challenge the player. The playable
character features a rabbit that has crashed on an unknown planet and has their
supplies floating in zero gravity due to the collision impact. The goal of the player is
to control the rabbit, float upwards using their jetpack, and stack the supplies
accordingly, in order to repair the ship and escape the planet which is currently
within the vicinity of a black hole.
